# VolunteerX

VolunteerX is a lightweight platform for engaging local communities in volunteering.
Local people can sign up to become on-demand volunteers.
NGOs can easily manage the real time deployment of skilled volunteers.

## TODOs:

1) Sign up with LinkedIn, Facebook & OpenID
2) Volunteer members heatmap
3) Stats dashboard
